# PRODIGY_CS_02
 image encryption tool using pixel manipulation by performing pixel  swapping operation by creating python program that can encrypt and decrypt image using  pixel values  swapping operation by allowing  users to input an image  to perform encryption and decryption.

 Pixel Manipulation:  
Pixel manipulation is altering or modifying pixels of an image to achieve a desired result.  The process of 
modifying the RGB values of each pixel in an image. A digital image is nothing more than dataâ€”numbers 
indicating variations of red, green, and blue at a particular location on a grid of pixels. Most of the time, we 
view these pixels as miniature rectangles sandwiched together on a computer screen. With a little creative 
thinking and some lower level manipulation of pixels with code, however, we can display that information in a 
myriad of ways. 

Image Encryption : 
Image encryption, fundamentally defined as the process of transforming a plain image into a coded form that 
can only be deciphered by its intended recipient , has gained increasing importance in response to the growing 
prevalence of image applications and the transmission of images over the internet and open networks. The 
critical information embedded within these images necessitates secure protection. 

Operations: 
Swapping Pixel values 
Pixel swapping in the context of pixel manipulation refers to the process of exchanging the values of pixels in 
an image. This can be done in various ways, such as swapping the color channels of each pixel (e.g., swapping 
the red and blue values) or swapping the positions of two or more pixels in the image.
